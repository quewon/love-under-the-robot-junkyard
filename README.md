# love-under-the-robot-junkyard
a bite-sized game by me
(made for Ludum Dare 48)

you’re a robot in the very junkyard where robots go to get discarded. your battery’s low, your core is failing you. but the bot you love is all the way at the bottom of this pile of rubble. you’d like to see them one last time.

played with KEYBOARD and MOUSE/TRACKPAD

made with HTML5/JS, LOGIC PRO X

and a LOT of UNSEEN BUGS
